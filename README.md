# PRJ301_Assignment
My assignment project for subject PRJ301 - Java Web App Development Bl5 Fall2022

Student's Name: Dang Duc Minh
Student's ID: HE163055
Start date: 6th Dec, 2022

Project name: online tri-language dictionary

This website is an online dictionary that lets user search/look up words' definitions from 3 different languages, namely: English, Japanese and Vietnamese.
All definitions will be in English to cater for all users coming from all parts of the world, as it is commonly considered the international language.

This is a 1-man project, researched and developed by an inexperienced programmer and is carried out with very limited time (around 2 weeks), therefore bugs and incompletions might be unavoidable. Nevertheless, he will try to complete the project even after the course of PRJ301 - Block 5 Fall 2022 is over as passing is not so much the point of the project. It is to prove the growth of the pertinent project's programmer and to have fun, if possible.
